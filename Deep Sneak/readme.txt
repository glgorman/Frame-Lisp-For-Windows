Here is the latest C++ source for some of the C++ code that was
converted from the Deep Seek Python distribution.  Not yet
working, but the file "convert.cpp" does compile if it can
be provided with headers that I doesn't otherwise complain
about.  Not quite sure what it does yet, bu working on
figuring out how to train custom models for it to do
various things.

Enjoy!
