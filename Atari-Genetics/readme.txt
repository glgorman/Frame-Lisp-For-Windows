This is the current build of C++ version of the experimental code
based on the code that I ported from Atari Basic that attempts
to implement a genetic algoritm in Atari BASUC.  After porting
to C++, I have made soem improvements to the orignal alorithm
as well as adding some intial features for working with
parallism, etc.

All very early.  Very experimental.
